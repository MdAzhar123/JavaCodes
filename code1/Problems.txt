1.Write a program that inputs a set of integers from the user
and prints the maximum and the minimum integers from the set.

Specimen input:
Enter the number of integers:
10
Enter the integers
5
1
59
9
3
7
35
5
21
19
Max=59
Min=1

2. Write a program that inputs any positive integer from the user
   and prints all its factors.
   Example :
   Input
    6
   Output 1 2 3 6

   Input
    18
   Output 1 2 3 6  9 18

3. Write a program that inputs an integer from the user and prints the next
   3 perfect numbers.A perfect number is one whose sum of its proper
   positive factors is the number itself.
   Example : 6=1+2+3.

4. Write a program that inputs a multi digit integer from the user
   and checks if the integer is a strong number.
   A strong number is one whose sum of the factorial of each of its digit
   equals to the integer.
   Example : 145=!1+!4+!5=1+24+120=145.
