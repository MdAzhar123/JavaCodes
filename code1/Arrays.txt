Array declaration -
In this step we specify that the variable is an array
and the type of data it can hold

Syntax:
datatype array_name[];
datatype[] arraay_name;
e.g
  int qty[];
  double[] prices;
  Point[] p;//Declares an array 'p' which can hold objects of the 'Point'   class

Array instantiation -
In Java an array is treated as an array.
In this step we create the array object and in the process
we allocate the size of the array.

Syntax:
arrayname=new datatype[size];
e.g qty=new qty[10];
    prices=new double[5];
    p=new Point[5];

length is an attribute of the array that holds the array size.

Q1.Write a program that accepts some positive integers 
   from the user and store them in a single dimension array.
   The program should print all the odd integers in one line
   and all the even integers in another line.

Specimen input:
How many integer ?
10
Enter the integers
1
2
3
-4
Enter a +ve integer
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Output
  The odd integers are 1 3 5 7 9
  The even integers are 2 4 6 8 10

Q2.
Input some positive integrs from the user and store them
in a single dimension array.
Next input an ineteger  from the user and if the integer
exists in the array delete the integer from the array
and print the array.

Specimen inputs :


How many integer ?
10
Enter the integers
1
2
3
-4
Enter a +ve integer
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Enter the integer to delete
7
The integer found in the array and deleted.
Printing the remaining elements from the array
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10

Specimen input 2

How many integer ?
5
Enter the integers
1
2
3
4
5
Enter the integer to delete
9
Sorry no such integer exists in the array
