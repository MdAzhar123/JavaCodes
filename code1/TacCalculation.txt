filed 'tax'. For initialising this field define a parameterised
constructor. Also override the toString() method for printing the

A student is not entitled for any tax, so override the method
calcTax() accordingly.

public Tax calculateTax(Person p).The method should be capable of receiving
object of any sub class of the Person class and invoke the required
